# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a sketch coloring created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



This project was a huge project for learning JavaScript better.

I had to do constant research to be able to implement the functions and code into what I wanted done on my page.

One of my biggest challenges I faced was how to properly add and remove event listeners to certain button onclick functions, and how to have my page identify what buttons were clicked. Along with that, the other challenges were having to get certain buttons to work together to perform certain functions together. 

I also struggled with making my grid with boxes, and how to be able to modify the size with input from the slider value. 

In the end, I was able to implement everything I wanted my page to do. I was also able to modify the look of my page at different screen sizes.

I will be able to implement so much of the JavaScript I learned with this project into any other project I make in the future.
